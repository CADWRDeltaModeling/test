# Essential git commands and techniques


## Basic
### First step
- `clone`

    Use this command to clone an existing repo. To clone this repo,

    `git clone https://github.com/CADWRDeltaModeling/test.git` 
    
    To change the name of the directory (e.g., "github_exercises"),

    `git clone https://github.com/CADWRDeltaModeling/test.git github_exercises`

- `init`

    Use this to create a new git repo. For example, running `git init` will make the current directory a git repo.

- `status`

- `add`

    This command stages the changes that have occurred in the local repo (modifying what is inside a file, creating a new file, removing an exsting file, etc. ).
